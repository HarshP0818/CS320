# Software Testing and Development Portfolio

This repository showcases selected work from two major projects completed during my course on software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The files demonstrate my skills in writing Java classes, creating and executing unit tests using JUnit, and reflecting on the development process. These examples reflect my ability to deliver functional and reliable code, as well as analyze and meet user requirements through appropriate software testing strategies.

## Included Files

**From Project One:**
- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`

**From Project Two:**
- Summary and Reflections Report

## Reflections

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring that my software is functional and secure starts with clearly understanding the requirements and then writing clean, modular code that is easy to test and maintain. I use unit testing frameworks like JUnit to verify each component of my program works as expected. To ensure security, I follow best practices such as input validation, encapsulation, and limiting access to sensitive data. Testing also includes boundary and edge cases to uncover hidden errors or vulnerabilities early in development.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by breaking down the project requirements into clear, actionable tasks and user stories. By asking what the user wants to accomplish, I can prioritize features and ensure that the code aligns with real-world use cases. This process involves reviewing requirements documents, using feedback loops, and sometimes creating mockups or test cases based on those needs. I then translate these needs into program logic, ensuring the interface and functionality match the intended use.

### How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design with a focus on clarity, scalability, and maintainability. I begin by outlining the core functionality and breaking it into smaller components or classes. I use object-oriented principles to model real-world entities, ensuring each class has a clear purpose. I then develop test cases alongside the design to validate functionality throughout the build process. Throughout, I remain adaptable, making improvements based on testing feedback and user input.
